# Example Uses of the Local LibCal Events Database

To get some creative ideas started, here are a few projects that can take advantage of the local LibCal events database:

1. [JSON Providers](json-providers/)
   This project doesn't display anything visually or graphically, but is the heart and soul of the other example projects. This provides an interface to query and filter, in a simple way, data from the database, and then generate data in a consumable fashion for other programs.
2. [A Random Event Slide](random-event/)
   This project shows how simple data can be retrieved, and then displayed in a custom layout. Some level of data massaging and filtering is used, but it's not too crazy.
3. [Hover-Style Cards](hover-cards/) (Widget?)
   This project showcases how one might be able to pull data from the database (via the JSON Providers), and then embed some customized, and nicely laid out event widgets onto their own website's content area. You have full control over the templates that can be created and rendered. All you need is the data, and the rest is totally under your control! This example aims to show that possibility.
